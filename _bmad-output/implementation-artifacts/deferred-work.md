## Deferred from: code review of sec-1-p0-dev-surface-hardening (2026-08-05)

- Dashboard dev actions need an operator-auth story before intentionally enabling them in any shared non-production environment. The current P0 story makes production fail-closed, but shared staging/dev environments still need caller authorization if `DASHBOARD_DEV_CONTROLS_ENABLED=true` is ever used outside a private local setup.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-6-define-runtime-retry-budget-and-error-mapping (2026-08-05)

- `ProcessMessageRequest` still keeps `requestId`, `eventId`, and `runtimeAttempt` optional for compatibility with the current shim boundary. A future tightening story should introduce or require a strict runtime-boundary request type once all existing TypeScript runtime callers have been migrated.
